### PHP Design Patterns

#### Factory Pattern
Allows to create object without needing direct access to implementation logic

    Advantages:
        Stantardising interfaces (e.g communication with different databases)

    Drawbacks:
        Refactoring may be difficult
        Subclasses may have a many boilerplate classes
